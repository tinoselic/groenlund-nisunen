          A large parabolic reflector, four metres in diameter and painted matt white, was embedded in the suspended
          ceiling of a two-storey gateway leading to the inner courtyard of the housing co-operative. The surface of the
          reflector was painted matt white to give as even a reflection as possible. Fitted around the reflector, but
          hidden by the suspended ceiling, were 24 vertical narrow-beam spotlights controlled by a computer. The program
          controlled each spotlight individually, adjusting the warmth and intensity of the white light, and taking the
          length of the day into account. The tone and brightness of the light on different sides of the reflector
          changed slowly, almost imperceptibly, giving an impression of movement and making faint patterns on its
          surface.
