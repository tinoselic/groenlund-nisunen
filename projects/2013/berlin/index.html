          A total of 50 long coil springs are stretched vertically between the floor and ceiling in an 8 x 8 grid. On
          the floor next to each coil spring is a solenoid. An 8 x 8 grid made of brass wire was stretched along the
          floor, in line with the grid of coil springs. The brass wires are connected to a power supply via a control
          unit. The wires stretched in one direction have a positive charge, while those stretched at right angles to
          them have a negative charge. The control unit randomly momentarily turns on the electricity to one positive
          wire and one negative wire at a time. If there is a solenoid where the two wires cross, it is turned on and
          hits the coil spring, making it resonate. The springs continue to resonate for some time, keeping the whole
          installation vibrating. The sharp clicking sounds made by the solenoids produce a random, but clear rhythm.

          Powerful neodymium magnets are suspended by steel wires from the ceiling of the gallery space. Vertically
          below each magnet is another one connected to the floor by a similar wire. The opposite poles of the two
          magnets face each other, with an approximately two-centimeter gap between them. The magnetic pull is greater
          than gravity.
          <br>
          <br>
          The magnet pairs, which are all in the same height, create an invisible conceptual plane between them. This
          motionless, apparently static work contains invisible tensions and forces, demonstrating elemental forces of
          nature we generally take for granted but that govern every aspect of our existence on the planet.

          A horizontal plane is set on a much smaller base. Narrow edges prevent tens of thousands of small steel balls
          from falling off the 140 x 140 cm surface of the horizontal section across which they keep moving. The light
          grey metal structure stands at about 35 cm above the floor and continuously tilts very slightly but steadily.
          The changing inclination would not be that noticeable, were it not for the movement of the balls. There are
          not enough of them to entirely cover the horizontal plane so that about a fifth of the mat grey surface
          underneath remains visible.

          The title refers to the name of the company producing the timepieces. The artists have removed the backing in
          order to reveal the mechanism inside the watch. Employing relatively simple but sophisticated means, using
          magnetism, electric currents, or simple gravitational forces, Tommi Grönlund and Petteri Nisunen create
          quietly evocative and formally striking works.
