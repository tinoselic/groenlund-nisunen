          Two beat frequency oscillators playing slightly different 50-60 Hz sine wave tones. The two sine waves
          interact in the space, creating a third so called interference sound. In certain spots, the sound is louder
          than elsewhere in the space, due to standing sound waves formed by reflected sound waves travelling to
          opposite directions.

          A stainless-steel container in the shape of a sphere is filled with freezing gel. It is then kept in a freezer
          overnight and displayed on a pedestal during the day, when the exhibition is open. The moisture in the air of
          the exhibition space condenses onto the cold surface of the artwork. Because it is highly polished, and hence
          hydrophobic, the water tends to condense on it in droplets. The surface of the work, which is otherwise
          reminiscent of a minimalist sculpture, is in a constant state of slow transformation, first freezing and then
          melting.

          The work plays on the physical properties of light, its transmission and perception. While the LED screen
          seems to produce a steady glow of white illumination, the ipad--because of the nature of its technological
          transformation of light waves into digital information--reproduces this sight as a pattern of white and black
          horizontal bars. That is, the tablet camera filming the LED panel records as horizontal “interfering” lines
          across the image what a human eye does not see: the intermittent waves constituting the LED light. Comparable
          to the horizontal lines produced when filming analogue television sets, the work uses a technological glitch
          to highlight the nature of light and its transformation by various technological means, as well as the
          limitations of human perception.

          A large acrylic aquarium is filled to the brim with half distilled water and half transparent silicone oil.
          Because silicone oil is less dense than water and they are immiscible, the oil floats on top of the water with
          a transparent, but clearly visible borderline between them. An electric actuator operated by limit switches
          and a control unit slowly tilts the aquarium back and forth, creating visible wave patterns at the boundary
          between the two liquids. The high viscosity of the oil makes the movement of the waves slow and dreamlike.
