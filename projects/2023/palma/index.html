            Duo show with Mario Klingemann, curated by Pau Waelder
          </i>
          <br>
          <br>
          The new gallery space was divided between us and German artist Mario Klingeman. Although we use very
          different working methods and media, we seem to share some underlying interests, which was the starting point
          for the curator's work.
          <br>
          <br>
          For this exhibition we showed completely new works as well as some new site-specific versions of existing
          work, made especially for this space. The exhibition included kinetic installation, hanging sculpture,
          objects, reliefs, and prints.

        <h3>Blind Zone</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          <i>Blind Zone</i> was based on the same principle as our earlier work Blinds Wide Shut (2023). Dark motorized
          blinds divided our side of the gallery into two parts. The randomly opening and shutting blinds constantly
          changed
          the way in which one could see and move from one side to the other.

          <i>Linkage</i>, a hanging sculpture made of transparent acrylic tubes, was a new work made in Palma de
          Mallorca during our residency before the exhibition.

          In <i>Spheres Tomography</i> interlocking spheres were created inside a layered cubic volume by removing
          material. The work appears very different when looked at from different angles.

        <br>
        <p>
          <i>Frozen Sphere</i> is a polished stainless-steel ball filled with frozen gel. It is kept in the freezer
          overnight
          and put on display in the morning. The moisture of the surrounding air condensates on its surface as small
          water droplets and keeps the work in a state of slow change all through the day.

        <h3>Arranged Randomness</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          <i>Arranged Randomness</i> is an ongoing series of works in which small stainless-steel balls stick on the
          wall and
          on top of each other in a grid pattern, seemingly on their own. This long site-specific version of the work
          was the second largest so far.

          Besides the works mentioned above, we exhibited a relief and a series of prints based on different Moiré
          patterns. This effect, which is most often considered as a problem or an error, has interested us over the
          years.
