          "Memoria Fragmentada" is an installation made in collaboration with Seppo Renvall for Fokus Finlandia -group
          exhibition in Kültur Büro Barcelona. Seppo Renvall's video “Woody” is projected on the back wall of the
          darkened rectangular exhibition space. The video, made of material shot by his father on 8mm film, shows two
          year old Seppo wondering around the garden of their summerhouse in mid 60's.

          In addition there are ten rounded double-sided mirrors hanging in a row between the projector and the
          projection wall. These mirrors rotate slowly with electric motors, about one round in a minute.
          The rotating mirrors reflect slowly orbiting spots of the video projection on the surrounding walls of the
          exhibition space. The spots reflected by mirrors close to the projector have wider view and
          more details in them where as the mirrors closer to the back wall reflect very abstract, low resolution spots
          of the original video.

          Since some of the mirrors rotate opposite direction the spots occasionally meet and overlap each other. This
          same effect is also caused by reflections passing the slower ones. Although all mirrors rotate at the same
          speed the reflected spots which are further from the source mirror are not only bigger but also move faster.

          The installation creates an atmosphere remindingdreams in which fragments of your past suddenly come into your
          mind in random order only to be forgotten again. The images which were so vivid at night fade into confused
          traces of them by the morning. What remains is kind of melancholic longing for innocence you cannot reach
          anymore.
