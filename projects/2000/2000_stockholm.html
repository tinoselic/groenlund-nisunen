          The Ultrasound installation consists of two facing parabolic mirrors placed about 20 meters (the longer the
          better) from each other. In the focal point of each mirror is a speaker and a small LED-light. The very high
          pitched sine wave sound played through the speakers create a kind of sound beam between the mirrors. In
          optimal accoustic conditions the sound is heard only between the mirrors, not elsewhere in the space.
          <br>
          <br>
          The pitch of the sound coming out of one of the speakers is about 16.000 Hz while the pitch of the sound
          coming out of the other speaker is moving randomly between 12.000 Hz and 20.000 Hz. This random movement of
          the pitch is caused by a geiger meter measuring the constantly changing background radiation of the air in the
          exhibition space.
          <br>
          <br>
          Besides the sounds coming from the speakers a spectator standing between the mirrors can hear a third sound
          which frequency is the difference of the two above mentioned frequencies. This modulation sound is coming from
          all around, its source cannot be defined. This phenomenon together with the two other high pitched sounds
          somewhat
          distorts the spectators perception of space.
