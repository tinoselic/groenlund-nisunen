          Two parallel steel wires approximately 30 cm apart are stretched diagonally across the exhibition space. An
          aluminium wheel with a steel axle moves back and forth along the wires. Attached to the middle of these
          horizontal wires is a pair of vertical wires connected to an electric actuator on a heavy platform on the
          floor. When the actuator pulls on the vertical wires, bending the horizontal wires downwards, the wheel begins
          to roll towards the middle of the room. When it rolls over the midpoint, a sensor - a strain gauge
          - detects it and the actuator slowly releases the vertical wire. The coil springs at the ends of the
          horizontal wires pull them straight, making it easy for the wheel to carry on moving towards the other corner
          with the momentum it has acquired earlier by rolling downhill. When it finally stopps, the sensor detects
          this, the actuator pulls the middle of the horizontal wires down again, and the wheel begins moving downhill
          in the opposite direction from before.

          A large acrylic aquarium is filled to the brim with half distilled water and half transparent silicone oil.
          Because silicone oil is less dense than water and they are immiscible, the oil floats on top of the water with
          a transparent, but clearly visible borderline between them. An electric actuator operated by limit switches
          and a control unit slowly tilts the aquarium back and forth, creating visible wave patterns at the boundary
          between the two liquids. The high viscosity of the oil makes the movement of the waves slow and dreamlike.

          <br>
          Two sine-wave oscillators emitted two slightly different low frequencies through two subwoofers in an old
          industrial space. The interference caused by the difference between these two frequencies generated a third,
          pulsing sound in the space. This very low frequency was adjusted so that it resonated with the space, creating
          what are known as standing sound waves at certain points in the space. This made visiting the work extremely
          physical, spatial, site-specific experience.

          A cubic stainless-steel container is filled with frozen gel. It is then kept in a freezer overnight and
          displayed on a pedestal during the day, when the exhibition is open. The moisture in the air of the exhibition
          space condenses onto the cold surface of the artwork. Because it is highly polished, and hence hydrophobic,
          the water tends to condense on it in droplets. The surface of the work, which is otherwise reminiscent of a
          minimalist sculpture, is in a constant state of slow transformation, first freezing and then melting.

          <br>
          The work consists of roughly one kilometre of bedrock samples collected for building the new metro line from
          Helsinki to Espoo. The samples are precisely marked, packed in wooden crates and given a code that indicates
          their place of origin. The sample crates are stacked as if in normal storage, except for the pieces of timber
          between them, which makes it possible to examine the contents of the boxes in greater detail. The immersive
          artwork deals with the idea of an archive, an invisible infrastructure, the relativity of different timespans,
          and the sheer presence of four tonnes of stone. The work is accompanied and accentuated by the low-frequency
          tones of the Helsinki Beat Frequency sound installation in the next room.

          The staged photograph is one of a small series shot in Tallinn in 2015, inspired by the 1980's site-specific
          work of the Estonian artist/architect Jüri Okas. We visited his home and some of the sites of his works during
          the process of making the artwork. The series of pictures is a continuation of the works in which, instead of
          working in an institution or public space easily reachable by the public, we choose a site that interests us,
          make our intervention, and document it with a photograph. Because the object is only experienced from a single
          point, through the camera lens, it raises questions about whether it or the photograph is the actual artwork.
          It is essential to use analogue photography here, as it emphasizes the authenticity of the picture.
