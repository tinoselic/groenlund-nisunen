          Based on their earlier exhibitions in Zagreb, Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Rijeka invited Grönlund
          and Nisunen to collaborate with Croatian artist Ivana Franke to Rijeka as part of Rijeka 2020 European Capital
          of
          Culture. The result of this collaboration was two large scale installations. Both works remain installed at
          their sites until end of 2020.

        <h3>Imminence</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          <i>
            Glass tubes, plastic elbow connectors, steel wire, screws and plugs, running water, sound system

          <br>
          <br>
          Imminence is a site-specific installation made especially for unused storage space of MMSU. Water coming from
          a tab flows very slowly through a 249 meters long glass tube hanging from the ceiling which wriggles its way
          through several rooms and ends up to the floor in last room. The long glass tube is made of 166 pcs of 1,5 m
          long parts joined by plastic elbow connectors into a three-dimensional structure in x,y,z grid. The shiny
          fragile material and geometrical form of the work contradict with the decayed interior of the space.
          <br>
          <br>
          One starting point of the work is the underground canal passing by the exhibition space, and sometimes
          flooding inside it. Another, more conceptual starting point is our growing awareness of the fact, that due to
          climate change getting fresh drinking water from tab is getting a rarity, which is available only in certain
          areas. Besides this dystopian progress, the title simply refers to the inevitability in which a visitor
          entering the space seeing the work instinctively knows what is about to happen in the other end.

        <h3>Time Slip</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          <i>Led panels, steel beams, wire, screws and plugs, control unit</i>
          <br>
          <br>
          Time Slip is a site-specific intervention made for Titov Trg, named after a communist revolutionary and
          statesman Josip Broz Tito, in the very center of Rijeka. The square has a rich history and is today popular
          meeting place for people in general and especially for local youth.
          <br>
          <br>
          Technically speaking the square is a bridge structure with Rjecina river flowing underneath it. The
          installation consists of linear led lights hanged underneath the square which great a line of light reaching
          from shore to shore. The linear led lights are controlled with a control unit enabling a strobe function. The
          composition running the light is made at site and the frequency of the flashing is adjusted according to flow
          of water underneath and phase of city life around the work.
          The conceptual idea of the work is to emphasize the important spot in the city, and momentarily freeze the
          flow of river and thus the flow of time. The work deals with time, history and memory in slightly melancholic
          way, reminding which kind of layers certain place conveys in the minds of people.
