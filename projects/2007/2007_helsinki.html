          “Laatikko” (The Box in Finnish) was both the formal and conceptual starting point of this group exhibition.
          The invited artists were asked to make a work either in or of a box, the measurements and proportions of which
          were free to choose. The boxes gave visual coherence for the miniature exhibition as whole and at the same
          time offered privacy for individual works of art. The exhibition presented versatile collection of
          installations using different media: sculpture, photography, video and light.

          Our work for the exhibition was an installation, “125 litraa äärettömyyttä” (125 Liters of Infinity). The
          interior of our 50x50x50 cm box was covered with mirror from all sides, except for an open one covered with
          transparent glass. In the center of the box, facing the viewer, was a grid made of 100 self blinking red
          led-lights. The enclosed mirrors multiplied the lights, giving an impression of endlessly continuing matrix of
          leds. At night, the inner surface of the transparent glass also worked as a mirror, making the impression
          completely three dimensional.
